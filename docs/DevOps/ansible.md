# Ansible

- Ansible is an open source tool that enables autoamtion, configuration and orchestration of infrastructure. Helps in:
    - Automation of app deployment
    - Manage multi server systems
    - Reduce complexity
- When using Ansible, we build out the entire system in code and store the code in source control. Rollbacks will be available when needed and the code can be shared with other team members. 
- Produces reliable and repeatable systems and reduces human error in spinning up the infrastructure multiple times. 
- Written in `Python` and the scripting language used is YAML. 
- Commands are sent to nodes (in parallel) via `SSH` and executed sequentially on each respective node.
