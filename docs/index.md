## Welcome
Welcome to my `DOCS` website. 

## What
In this wiki website, you will find documentation ranging from Linux and Networking to AWS Cloud and DevOps tools that I use on a daily basis. 

## Why
While I navigate all the DevOps and Cloud resources online, I intend to document what I learnt as a wiki of all things needed for a Cloud DevOps Engineer. Neither do I claim copyrights to any of the material here as this is only for educational purposes nor I claim this material as my own.


You can find [setup and support](Support/jekyll-website/) documentation for this website and my other wesbites.
