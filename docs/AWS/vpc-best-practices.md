# VPC Best Practices

- Choose proper VPC configuration based on present and future needs
    - It is advisable to design your Amazon VPC implementation based on your expansion requirements looking ahead at least two years. 
- Choose proper CIDR block for VPC.
    - The permissible size of the CIDR block ranges between /16 netmask and a /28 netmask.
    - While designing your Amazon VPC architecture to communicate with the on-premises data center, it is required that the CIDR range used in Amazon VPC does not overlap or cause a conflict with the CIDR block in the on-premises data center.
- Isolate dev, testing and prod environments
    - It is always better to create a distinct Amazon VPC for development, production, and staging â€“ or one Amazon VPC with Separate Security/Subnets/isolated NW groups for staging, production, and development.
- Securing your AWS VPC implementation
    - web application firewall or a firewall virtual appliance.
    - configure intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention virtual appliances.
    - IAM, you can audit and monitor Administrator access to your VPC.
- Create Disaster recovery plan
    - Developing a disaster recovery plan with respect to your VPC implementation is of critical importance
- Traffic control and Security
- VPC peering
    - Interconnected applications requiring private and secure access inside AWS.
    - Systems have been deployed in different AWS accounts by some business units and are required to be either shared or consumed privately
    - Better integrated access of systems, such as when a customer can peer their VPC with their core suppliers.
- EC2 instances in private subnets
    - While using ELB for web applications, ensure that you place all other EC2 instances in private subnets wherever possible. 
    - secure practice dictates that only ELBs must be in the public subnet.
- Tagging
    - use a tagging policy to efficiently organize resources for reporting.
